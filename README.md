Framework Components: The architecture comprises multiple interworking components, keeping it
manageable despite its complexity.

Cucumber and Gherkin: Cucumber allows for feature files written in Gherkin syntax,
which act as executable specifications. Step definitions provide the necessary glue code,
 with hooks managing the WebDriver lifecycle.

Page Object Model (POM): The framework utilizes a POM design, where each page object
corresponds to a page or a component of the application.
 A base page is established to handle wait strategies and initialize page parentCucumber.customType.factory elements.

Domain Objects and Custom Types:
 In Cucumber, domain objects (like product and customer addresses) are created,
  with custom types converting Gherkin data to these objects.

Rest Assured Integration:
 The framework includes reusable methods for API interactions via Rest Assured,
  covering GET and POST requests while managing cookies.

Test Context and Dependency Injection:
A test context shares WebDriver objects, domain objects, and cookies among step definitions.
Dependency injection is facilitated by the Picco container library.

Configuration and Utilities:
Common utilities and configuration files are highlighted, including settings for Cucumber,
 environment properties, and JSON for test data management.

Execution and Reporting:
The framework uses JUnit for executing scenarios, integrates with Maven for project management,
 and supports CI/CD with GitHub and Jenkins. Reporting utilizes Cucumber and potentially Serenity reports.

Best Practices:
 Emphasis is placed on Gherkin best practices, scenario independence, and setting application state via APIs.
 Principles like Single Responsibility and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) are underscored.

Future Demonstrations:
The instructor plans to demonstrate these concepts in practice throughout the course,
encouraging engagement from viewers to deepen their understanding.
